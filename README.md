# *SIMPLE*

This is my latest project ( and am currently working on it ) which is a front-end only! But, plan to make it full-stack.

This isn't the deployed code it is a sample. Here is the deployed site : https://simplev5.vercel.app/

### What I plan to add:
* Signin/Signup(via some authentication)
* Redesign the front page a little
* A dashboard with some functions of the user
* And more...

### Technologies:
* React
* CSS
* Next
* Typescript

The main thing this is a templete where I showcase what I can build and is missing some context/story.
